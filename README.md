Dissertation currently version 5.

An interesting opportunity prompted me to complete this dissertation a year prior to when I initially planned. Please comment on any typos you find and they will be corrected in bold with a footnote acknowleding your contribution. E.g.  Section 2.2 footnote 3 reads ``Nathan Gabriel revised the concluding sentence of this paragraph to correct an ambiguous pronoun."
